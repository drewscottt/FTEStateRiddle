Suppose you remove a set of states (not necessarily four) so that you have two distinct contiguous regions among the lower 48 states, where the larger region has area A and the smaller region has area B. What states should you remove to maximize area B? (Was Philip’s intuition correct?) And what percentage of the lower 48 states’ combined area does B represent?

My answer: IL, MO, NE, CO, NM. Results in smaller half having 43% of the total area.
